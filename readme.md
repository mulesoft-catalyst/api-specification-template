# API Specification Template

## Introduction

This asset provides a basic template for a RAML based REST API. It has best practices around naming and documentation baked in and allows API Designers to not only speed up the development of a RAML Specification but also ensures consistency across all specifications.

This asset is expected to be used with the Common RAML Fragments asset also provided through Catalyst Knowledge Hub.

## Usage Instructions

1. Create a new API Specification project in Design Centre named: "API Specification Template"
2. Add all the contents of this repository into a ZIP excluding the license and readme.md file.
3. Go to your Design Centre Project and choose "Import", then select the ZIP.
4. Ensure you set the root RAML as the one which has been imported.
5. Replace the {your-group-id-here} and {latest-version} in the commented fragment usage on line 37 once you have imported the Common RAML Fragments dependency.
6. Publish this asset to Exchange.
7. This asset can now be imported into any new API Specification Design Centre project to use as a template and accelerator.
